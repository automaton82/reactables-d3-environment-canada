## Reactables with React, d3 and Environment Canada weather data

This sample is based on [react-d3-example](https://github.com/sxywu/react-d3-example) but modified to use [Environment Canada data](https://api.weather.gc.ca/) instead of static, and to use [Reactables](https://github.com/reactables/reactables) to provide the data via API calls.

### Running

First run `npm start` as per [react-d3-example available scripts](https://github.com/sxywu/react-d3-example?tab=readme-ov-file#npm-start). Then launch the browser and point it at `http://localhost:3000/` or use the built-in vscode `msedge` launcher via `Start Debugging` -> `Launch Edge`.
