## Reactables with React, d3 and Environment Canada weather data

This sample is based on [react-d3-example](https://github.com/sxywu/react-d3-example) but modified to use [Environment Canada data](https://api.weather.gc.ca/) instead of static, and to use [Reactables](https://github.com/reactables/reactables) to provide the data via API calls.
